# Archivey Documentation

Archivey offers a unified way to read and extract common archive formats such as ZIP, TAR, RAR, 7z and ISO. It works in streaming or random access mode and provides a small command line interface.

See the [README](../README.md) for installation instructions and quick examples.
The README also describes the [command line interface](../README.md#command-line-usage),
which is mainly intended for testing the library.
